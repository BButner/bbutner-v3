## Introduction

Recently I have been working on redesigning my personal portfolio website, and I wanted to
make it look like the macOS interface. This in itself is quite an undertaking, however I have
been making significatn progress.

One component I wanted to add to the Menu Bar was the "Currently Playing" icon, that would,
of course, display what I'm currently playing. I've interacted with the Spotify API previously
so I knew that part would not be very difficult, and this wouldn't take very long to implement
completely.

## Starting

The first task was figuring out where I wanted to host the API server, and what language I wanted to
write it in. I've been getting into [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) lately, so I figured I would start there!
I searched around and quickly I found that [Rocket](https://rocket.rs) was a fairly popular choice
to host an API server.

I created my project, and before creating the API server I wanted to get the fetching from Spotify up
and running before implementing the server. I very quickly found [Rspotify](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify),
which looked like it would accomplish exactly what I needed to do.

It was actually very simple to contact the Spotify API and get what I was currently playing:

```rust
let access_token_opt = env::vars().find(|(key, _)| key == ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY);
let refresh_token_opt = env::vars().find(|(key, _)| key == REFRESH_TOKEN_KEY);

if access_token_opt.is_some() && refresh_token_opt.is_some() {
    let access_token = access_token_opt.unwrap().1;
    let refresh_token = refresh_token_opt.unwrap().1;

    let token = build_token(&access_token, &refresh_token);

    let mut spotify = AuthCodeSpotify::from_token(token);

    let current = spotify.current_playing(None, None::<&[_]>).await;

    if current.is_ok() {
        let current_unwrapped = &current.unwrap();
        if current_unwrapped.is_some() {
            return build_response(&current_unwrapped.clone().unwrap());
        }
    }
}
```

This is just a snippet obviously, as the actual result from Spotify gets cached and is only
re-fetched every 10 seconds. If this was a more mission-critical piece of information, I would
add more features like calculating time until the song ends, to make sure we catch it at the start,
a lower delay, etc.

Now all that's left to do is enable TLS, Dockerize this, and throw it on a VPS and call it a day!
Just that easy, right? *Wrong...*

## The Issue

I started looking around the documentation for Rocket, and eventually I came upon [this](https://rocket.rs/v0.5-rc/guide/configuration/#tls)
page, to start enabling TLS for the webserver. I quickly found the warning that it only supports
TLS 1.2 and 1.3, which "may not be suitable for production use." 

I originally found [this gist](https://gist.github.com/belst/ff36c5f3883f7bf9b06c379d0a7bed9e) that
ran into the same situation, and attempted to get around it. However, since my nginx server is only
ever going to host a single page, these instructions seemed more involved than what I needed
to accomplish for my situation.

That's fine, I can easily get around that with a little bit of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and
[nginx](https://nginx.org/en/).

The first thing I did was hop on my VPS and install nginx:

```
sudo apt install nginx
```

Next up, is installing a [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificate using [this Certbot page](https://certbot.eff.org/instructions?ws=nginx&os=ubuntufocal).
That handled everything for me, and now when I navigated to [my api](https://api.bbutner.com), I was greeted with SSL,
and the nginx default landing page.

Now for Docker, I followed the instructions on [this page](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).

Finally, all I had to do was build my:

*Dockerfile*
```
FROM rust:latest

WORKDIR /app

COPY . .

EXPOSE 8000
ENV ROCKET_PORT=8000

RUN if [ ! -f "Cargo.toml" ]; then cargo init . ; fi
RUN cargo install --path .

CMD ["/app/target/release/bbutnerv3-backend"]
```

and then:

*docker-compose.yml*
```yml
version: '3'

services:
  app:
    build:
      context: .
    image: beaubutner/bbutner:v3-backend
    ports:
      - "1337:8000" 
```

I kept port 1337 since that was the original inspiration for this workaround.

I spun up the container and navigated to the HTTP endpoint, and verified that it was
properly functioning on port 1337, which I then closed off via the firewall. All that
was left to do is to enable the proxy pass in nginx.

```
sudo nvim /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
```

In there, I found this section:

```
location / {
        # First attempt to serve request as file, then
        # as directory, then fall back to displaying a 404.
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
}
```

And changed it to:

```
location / {
        # First attempt to serve request as file, then
        # as directory, then fall back to displaying a 404.
        #try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:1337;
}
```

I now navigated to [my Spotify endpoint](https://api.bbutner.com/spotify) and voila, 
working perfectly!
